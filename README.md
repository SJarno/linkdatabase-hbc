A school project - HBC

Production release can be found here: https://linkdatabase-hbc-practice.herokuapp.com/

## About
A project for school I builded for future reference. Went bit over with this one, but practice is practice.

User can add different www-links via admin page for display. There is only one user with one user role. 

Built with Spring Boot, and basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Postgresql is used in production.

## Future updates:
Tests, and some. The newer versions on Boot is slightly different from what I'm used to regardin Spring Boot tests, so I deffinently need to take a hold on that.
