A school project - HBC

The original assignment was much simpler, and did not contain any frontwork with appealing visual look. The idea was just to post data to local in-memory db, and get data to display on a table etc. No authentication nor prod release involved.

Note: not in prod anymore in Heroku as free dynos will not be available in near future.

## Note:
If you are interested testing the functionality in admin(adding www-links) in production, please contact me via jarno.saastamoinen@hotmail.com

## About
A project for school I builded for future reference. Went bit over with this one, but practice is practice.

User can add different www-links via admin page for display. There is only one user with one user role. 

Built with Spring Boot, and basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Postgresql is used in production.

## Future updates:
Tests, and some. The newer versions on Boot is slightly different from what I'm used to regardin Spring Boot tests, so I deffinently need to take a hold on that.
